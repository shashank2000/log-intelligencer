K: 10
Answer: The leader is 127.0.0.1:1025.
---
K: 20
Answer: The leader is 127.0.0.1:1025.
---
K: 50
There is no information in the logs about who the leader is.
---
K: 100
There is no answer to the query "who is the leader" in the given logs. The logs only contain information about the initialization of servers, errors, committing changes to persistent storage, becoming a follower, sending request votes, winning elections, appending log entries, and applying log entries to the state machine.

QUERY: what servers were initialized
K: 5
Answer: The servers that were initialized are 127.0.0.1:1025, 127.0.0.1:1026, and 127.0.0.1:1027.
---
K: 10
Servers that were initialized are:
- 127.0.0.1:1025
- 127.0.0.1:1026
- 127.0.0.1:1027
---
K: 20
Servers that were initialized are:
- 127.0.0.1:1025
- 127.0.0.1:1026
- 127.0.0.1:1027
---
K: 50
Servers that were initialized are: 
- 127.0.0.1:1025
- 127.0.0.1:1026
- 127.0.0.1:1027
---
K: 100
Servers that were initialized are: 
- 127.0.0.1:1025
- 127.0.0.1:1026
- 127.0.0.1:1027

This can be determined from the logs that show the servers being initialized and committing changes to persistent storage.

QUERY: who are the current followers
K: 5
Based on the given logs, the current followers cannot be determined as all the nodes became followers at some point and the latest log entry does not provide any information about the current state.
---
K: 10
Answer: The current followers are 127.0.0.1:1026 and 127.0.0.1:1027.
---
K: 20
Answer: Based on the given logs, it is not possible to determine who the current followers are. The logs only show the actions taken by the nodes in a distributed system, specifically a Raft consensus algorithm implementation. It does not provide information about the current state of the system, including which nodes are currently followers.
---
K: 50
Answer: The logs do not contain information about current followers. The logs only contain information about the state of a distributed consensus algorithm, such as Raft.
---
K: 100
Answer: The logs do not contain information about followers. It appears to be a log of events related to a distributed system or application, such as a consensus protocol.

--------------------
QUERY: what server has crashed
K: 5
There is no information in the given logs to determine which server has crashed.
---
K: 10
Based on the given logs, there is not enough information to determine which server has crashed. None of the logs indicate that a server has crashed.
---
K: 20
Based on the given logs, there is no clear indication that a server has crashed. The logs mainly show the state changes and updates to the persistent storage of the servers. It is possible that a crash occurred outside of the scope of these logs, or that the query is not relevant to the given logs.
---
K: 50
Based on the given logs, it is not clear which server has crashed. There are several errors related to connecting to servers, but none that explicitly state a server has crashed. Further information or logs may be needed to determine which server has crashed.
---
K: 100
Based on the given logs, it is not clear which server has crashed. There are multiple errors indicating that the server is unable to connect to 127.0.0.1:1026 and 127.0.0.1:1027, but it is not specified which server is generating these errors. More information is needed to determine which server has crashed.

QUERY: describe the last election
K: 5
Answer: The last election was won by the node with IP address 127.0.0.1:1025 and it became the leader in term 1. Nodes with IP addresses 127.0.0.1:1026 and 127.0.0.1:1027 voted for 127.0.0.1:1025 in this election.
---
K: 10
Answer: Based on the given logs, it is not possible to describe the last election in detail. However, it can be inferred that an election took place and 127.0.0.1:1025 won the election and became the leader in term 1. After that, a command was applied to the state machine which resulted in the output "graduating! see ya!" being displayed on all three nodes.
---
K: 20
Answer: The last election was won by 127.0.0.1:1025 who became leader in term 1. After the election, the state machine applied two log entries, the first one was "echo "cs349d rocks!" and the second one was "echo "graduating! see ya!". All three nodes (1025, 1026, 1027) applied the same commands to the state machine and their outputs were "cs349d rocks!" and "
---
K: 50
Answer: The logs show that an election was held, and node 127.0.0.1:1025 won the election and became the leader in term 1. The leader then appended two log entries, "echo "cs349d rocks!"" and "echo "graduating! see ya!"", which were applied to the state machine successfully. However, there was an error connecting to node 127.0.0.1:1026.
---
K: 100
Answer: The logs do not provide information about the last election. The logs show a series of events related to a server's state changes, client requests, and errors related to connecting to servers.
